MA - mobile application
WA - web application
MW - using both
3.4. -- MA --- click on 'new scan' does nothing,
	WA --- changed checking hashed passd == passwd to passwd == passwd --- change in future to hash == hash
	   --- TODO : password being saved in plain text, change to hash
		    : when creating user in admin interface password not hashed, otherwise password saved as hash
	MW --- generating OTP and logging with old user works fine
